.SH NAME
42sh \- C shell with command execution handling
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B 42sh \fR[\fB\-h\fR] [\fB\-b\fR]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fI42sh\fR is an enhanced but completely compatible version of the Berkeley
UNIX C shell, \fItcsh\fR(1).
It is a command language interpreter usable both as an interactive login
shell and a shell script command processor.
It includes a command-line editor (see \fBThe command-line editor\fR),
programmable word completion (see \fBCompletion and listing\fR),
spelling correction (see \fBSpelling correction\fR),
a history mechanism (see \fBHistory substitution\fR),
job control (see \fBJobs\fR)
and a C-like syntax.
The \fBNEW FEATURES\fR section describes major enhancements of \fI42sh\fR
over \fItcsh\fR(1).
Throughout this manual, features of
\fI42sh\fR not found in most \fItcsh\fR(1) implementations
(specifically, the 4.4BSD \fItcsh\fR)
are labeled with '(+)', and features which are present in \fItcsh\fR(1)
but not usually documented are labeled with '(u)'.
